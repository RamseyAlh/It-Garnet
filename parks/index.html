          <h3>What to Know</h3>
          <p>Situated in the Arkansas River Valley just 45 minutes from Arkansas Wine Country, 
            his state park sits atop the 1,350-foot Mount Nebo. The 1930s-era Civilian Conservation Corps
             constructed many of the rustic-style cabins, pavilions, bridges, and 32.6 miles of hiking and mountain biking trails.
              Cabin 1 was the first cabin rental in state park history. Twelve of the parkâ€™s 
              15 cabins are located along the bluff and have views of the river valley below. 
              Most of the campsites do as well. There are 34 campsites (24 Class B and 10 hike-in tent sites). 
              Note: there is not a dump station at the park. Other facilities include a swimming pool (fee required), 
            tennis courts, picnic areas, pavilions, and a visitor center with a gift shop.</p>
          <p>
            Mount Nebo State Park is a certified Trail of Tears National Historic Trail Site.

Mount Nebo offers panoramic views of the Arkansas River from the Rim Trail.
