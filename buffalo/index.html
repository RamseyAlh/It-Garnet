    <h3>Swimming Holes</h3>
    <p>Want to swim even when the Buffalo river is too low? You donâ€™t have to worry about that! There are many great swimming spots around for you to enjoy! There are spots like Steel Creek Campground and Ponca Access, both amazing spots to take a dip in the water.
    </p>
    <h5>Ponca access</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>To get there, go past the BOC store about 200 yards, passing the Hwy 74 junction. About 40 yards beyond this junction is the gravel road that leads to the old low water bridge. Turn left here and follow the road the short distance back to the parking area.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steel Creek</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Take Hwy 74 S out of Ponca about a mile to the Steel Creek entrance. Go down the mountain, where the paved road ends and you can turn left or right. Turn left and go back around to the campground. Park near the end of the campground and walk across the camping area to the tree line, watching for footpaths that lead down to the river.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Picnic</h3>
    <p>Pack up your picnic basket and have a nice time being around nature with a great meal! The Buffalo offers many beautiful spots to have a nice picnic. Whether that be right next to your cabin, or even off on a hiking trail somewhere. Nothing beats having a picnic on a relaxing day next to a swimming hole either!
